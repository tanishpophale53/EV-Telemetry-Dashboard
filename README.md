# EV Telemetry System

As of now, electric vehicles manufactures are creating their own telematics dashboard to show the parameters like speed, range, battery stat, etc. Let say if a person having bajaj electric vehicle will have a different looking dashboard compared with his friend B having ola electric vehicle.

Consider a scenario where a person A needs to drive the ola electric vehicle of his friend B, then person A may find some difficulty in understanding the ola electric vehicle dashboard. So address the above problem, we built a realtime standard EV Telematics dashboard for all electric vehicles so that any person can easily understand the functionalities of dashboard in simple way. 

To the above problem statement, we won 1st prize in India's biggest EV competition named as ICreate.

The standard EV Telematics dashboard is built using Thingsboard - An opensource IoT platform. Initially various sensors like temperature, gyro were attached to a controlled system named as aries and this aries hardware system was connected to raspberry PI and raspberry PI was connected to thingsboard server. So if the latitude or longitude of a vehicle changes or temperature changes immediately it will update in realtime on IoT dashboard.Similarly, if a battery status of a vehicle changes immediately it will get update in the dashboard.

## Glimpse of IoT Dashboard
